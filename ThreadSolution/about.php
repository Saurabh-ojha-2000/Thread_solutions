            What is a Thread Solutions?
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size:25px;">
            A Thread Solutions  is a conversation. The question (or discussion statement) begins the conversation,
            and the replies to the thread starters are the responses.<br>

        <ul type="disc" style="font-size:20px;">
            <li>Provides an increased feeling of community for thread starters, replying users, and others who see the
                thread.</li>
            <li>Provides specialized types of threads (discussion and Q&A).</li>
            <li>Provides counters (likes for discussion; for Q&A, I have this question too counter and this helped me
                counter;
                for Q&A, suggested answer and verified answer).</li>

            Feeling of community
        </h2>
        <p>
            A forum is based on the community archetype. In discussion threads, one member posts a topic, and other
            members respond.
            In Q&A threads, a member poses a question, and then works with other group members who answer the question.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants can indicate the relevance of the question by clicking "I have this question too" or "This
            helped me."
            Discussion and Q&A forums work differently, but they both increase community engagement.
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-3"> Counters</h2>
        <p>
            The I have this question and This helped me counters are used to track Q&A questions. Verified answers
            are determined by a configurable threshold.
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-3"> Our Mission:</h2>
        <p>To enable all developers to achieve their goals by providing an energized and collaborative community,
            comprehensive resources, and need-driven tools.</p>
        <p>
            They are simple statements, but they are, in essence, the purpose and long-term goal for
            developingForums.org.
            I encourage you to read the full statement as it offers a much more detailed explanation.
        <p>
            I would like to solicit help of the community in identifying and agreeing upon our core values. What do we
            value as individuals, writers, and members of this website? What values will help us achieve our goal of
            enabling all writers? What values will help us build a stronger community?
        </p>
        <p>
            Core values are important because they help shape our vision and the culture around our community. When
            applied, they become a part of our community identity. Ultimately, they will help keep us grounded and make
            our community stronger.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-3"> Our Vision:</h2>
        <p>
            To enable developers to achieve their goals.
